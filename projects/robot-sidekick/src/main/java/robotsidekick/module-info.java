/**
    - Starter classes: You have four classes in the starter code:
 sidekickencapsulation.SideKick: Contains predefined properties and methods.
 WhatADriver: Initially empty, to be implemented.
 superheroes.sidekickencapsulation.schedule.onlineshoppingplatformsimulation.mediaplayer.classyshapesproject.bmicalculatorapplab.array.counting.vowel.zoofinalproject.Main: Contains the main() method for user interaction.
 Robot: Target for moving common properties and method.

    - Superclass creation:
 Move common properties and methods to a new parent  Robot class.
 Make Robot an abstract class to prevent instantiation.

    - Subclass updates:
 sidekickencapsulation.SideKick: Update to extend Robot and use inherited functionality.
 WhatADriver: Create and extend Robot, implementing necessary methods.

    - Implementing abstract methods:
 Declare abstract methods in Robot.
 Implement these methods in sidekickencapsulation.SideKick and WhatADriver.

    - Exploring reusability:
 Reflect on how inherited methods and properties streamline and enhance code reusability and maintainability.
